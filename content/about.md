I've been programming and learning about computing since the age of 15, and I've been playing with Swift, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java/Kotlin, C, Python, and nowadays I focus on Go. In addition, I am enthusiastic about open-source software (mainly in the Linux ecosystem), and maintain several personal projects on GitHub.

At the moment I'm studying a bachelor degree in computer science. So far I have some experience as source code contributor in a research project, and I've been a committee member in the Monash Cyber Security Club (colloquially known as MonSec), while fulfilling the roles of general representative, secretary and vice president.

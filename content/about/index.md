I've been programming and learning about computing since the age of 15, and I've been playing with [Swift](https://www.swift.org), JavaScript/[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), Java/[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), C/C++, [Python](https://python.org), and nowadays I focus on [Go](https://go.dev). In addition, I am enthusiastic about open-source software (mainly in the Linux ecosystem), and maintain several personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/AppleGamer22).

At the moment I'm studying a bachelor's degree in computer science. So far I have some experience as source code [contributor](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/FIT2082) in a research project, and I've been a committee member in the Monash Cyber Security Club (colloquially known as [MonSec](https://monsec.io/team/)), while fulfilling the roles of general representative, secretary, vice president and president.

In my spare time, I like to play the guitar and learn genres such as rock and blues.

# Background
I've been programming and learning about computing since the age of 15, and I've been playing with [Swift](https://www.swift.org), JavaScript/[TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), Java/[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), C/C++, [Python](https://python.org), and nowadays I focus on [Go](https://go.dev). In addition, I am enthusiastic about open-source software (mainly in the Linux ecosystem), and maintain several personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/AppleGamer22). In my personal projects, I like to use modern tools such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Buf](https://buf.build), [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Nix](https://nixos.org), [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org), as well as modern practices such as [CI/CD](/tags/ci/cd/).

## Open-Source Contributions
* [`google/osv-scanner`](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/pulls?q=author%3AAppleGamer22)
* [`sigstore/cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pulls?q=author%3AAppleGamer22)
* [ELEA](https://github.com/HPI-ELEA/elea/pulls?q=author%3AAppleGamer22)
* [Lazy CBS fork](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/FIT2082)

## Experience
Between 2020 to 2023 I studied a bachelor's degree in computer science. So far, I have some experience as source code [contributor](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/FIT2082) in a research project, and I've been a committee member in the Monash Cyber Security Club (colloquially known as [MonSec](https://monsec.io/contact_team/#2023-team)), while fulfilling the roles of general representative, secretary, vice president and president from 2021 to 2023. In addition, I have recently been assisting my friends at [Radio Monash](https://www.radiomonash.online) in software deployments and server migrations of their digital infrastructure.

# Set-up
I use the following components for my personal projects. If I'm involved in commercial work, these components will change based on the functional requirements of the project.

## Software
* [NixOS](https://nixos.org) is my main Linux distribution of choice, coupled with [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) as the desktop environment. I'm following the development of [System76's COSMIC](https://system76.com/cosmic/) as a possible alternative.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my main code editor. I'm following the development of [Zed](https://zed.dev) as a possible alternative.
* [`zsh`](https://www.zsh.org) is my preferred UNIX-like shell (my current [non-Nix configuration](/posts/shell/)).
	* [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs) is my favourite shell prompt configuration tool.
	* [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is my favourite interactive command history tool.

## Hardware
* AMD X570 desktop
* Raspberry Pi 4B
<!-- * Apple MacBook Pro -->

# Hobbies
In my spare time, I like to play the guitar and learn genres such as rock and blues.

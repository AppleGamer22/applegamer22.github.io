# The Beginning
My first year in university wasn't normal, due to the COVID-19 pandemic I had to adjust to both learning from home and to socialising in a complexly new environment with more restrictive means of interactions. The following year's orientation week, I noticed some familiar names on the cohort's Discord server mentioning they will be representing the cyber-security club at the student association's orientation festival. Since I didn't know anybody else that went to that event, I decided to check their booth out. The first 2 people I met from MonSec were Leo and Luca, who were super-friendly, they asked me of my previous experience and presented me with nifty lock-picking and cryptography challenges. The most memorable part was when Leo asked me of my previous experience, and I jokingly said "~~[I use Arch by the way](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch)~~" (note to self: that joke went horribly in retrospective).

## Assistant Member Training Officer
It turns out that there were some available positions in the MonSec committee at the beginning of 2021, I was pondering if I should try applying. I asked Leo about it during a Java class we both attended, and he said that I should go for it. In the application form, I wrote a short summary about myself, with [a link to my GitHub](https://github.com/AppleGamer22), in order to showcase my previous experience as evidence to my work ethic. That seemed to make the difference, because after a few weeks, the committee announced that I got accepted, and I asked them why it turns out I was of a few people that included external hyperlinks as evidence to my projects.

During this period of a semester and a bit, I learned about how MonSec works from behind the scenes, ran an online workshop whose demo didn't go as planned (immensely valuable for troubleshooting future workshops). The conversation I remember the most from this period was my introduction to the then-secretary, Luke who told that the MonSec team culture is based on recognising that the MonSec committee members are students, thus being relatively relaxed with deadlines is a requirement. At the time, I didn't understand how critical it was that we made that part of the team culture official from the start of each term, but it made [my presidency](#president) much more enjoyable.

## Secretary
The following year I moved to a more paperwork-heavy and administrative role, that involved record keeping of the committee and general meetings. I found it hard to parallelise the functions of documenting the meeting, and being attentive to what is being said. This struggle lead me to use several methods of documentation, such as a multi-media recording of the meeting, thus diversifying the dependency from one source of truth to multiple. In addition, I saw an opportunity to automate some repetitive routines, mainly the generation of plots for the semi-annual general meeting reports. I wrote a Python script that ingests the membership log of the club, and produces a set of plots for the secretary to use in their report.

# Main Takeaways
This post would have been meaningless if I wouldn't have laid out my key lessons from being part of MonSec:

* Keep nurturing a wholesome team culture, **everything else depends on that**.
* Learn from experiences of previous committees (and from yours as well).
* Focus on your club's mission according to its definition.
* Understand and mitigate your skill deficiency over time.
* Engage with the club members as much as possible, and ask them how the club is doing.

I'm sure MonSec will continue being just as or even more of a wholesome group of passionate ethical hackers, and even though I'm no longer involved in its leadership I'll always be happy to help them out where I can.

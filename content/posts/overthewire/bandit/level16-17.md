# Prompt
> The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **a port on `localhost` in the range 31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

# Solution
```sh
$ ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org password: cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap --script ssl-cert -p 31000-32000 localhost
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
31046/tcp open     unknown
31518/tcp filtered unknown
31691/tcp open     unknown
31790/tcp open     unknown
31960/tcp open     unknown
# trial and error
bandit16@bandit:~$ echo "cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet -verify_quiet
Correct!

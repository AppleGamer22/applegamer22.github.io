## Current Projects
### Go (Programming Language)
* [`cocainate`](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/cocainate) is a **cross-platform** re-implementation of the macOS utility [`caffeinate`](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/PowerManagement/tree/main/caffeinate) that keeps the screen turned on either until stopped, for a set duration of time or while another process still runs.
* [`stalk`](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/stalk) is a **cross-platform** file-watcher that can run a command after each file-system operation on a given file(s) or simply wait once until a file is changed.
* [rake](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/rake) is a social media scraper that is interfaced via a server-side rendered HTML interface (or a CLI), and is managed by a REST API and a NoSQL database.

## Other Projects
### TypeScript
* [scr-web](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/scr-web) (and its [scr-cli](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/scr-cli) counterpart) is my previous attempt at building a full-stack social media scraper, which was abandoned due to the excessive number of dependencies and the rather large build-size.

### Kotlin
* [sp](https://github.com/AppleGamer22/sp) is my first attempt at building a Minecraft server plugin. This plugin adds the requirement that the player supplies the password (via a server command) before proper server interaction is allowed. Until as password is provided, the currently-unauthorized player is blinded and immobile.

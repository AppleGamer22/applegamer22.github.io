A compilation of my Mutahar-inspired memes. In his (incredibly wholesome) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SomeOrdinaryGamers), he discusses video games, ownership in the modern era of digital software distribution and uses of open-source software. His genuine takes on internet culture and thoughtful lyrical masterpieces have bestowed joy and laughter on a certain cyber-security club's Discord server.

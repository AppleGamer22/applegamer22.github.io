	\section{Projects}
	\subsection{Open-Source}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \href{https://github.com/AppleGamer22/cocainate}{\texttt{cocainate}} is a cross-platform re-implementation of the macOS utility \href{https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/PowerManagement/tree/main/caffeinate}{\texttt{caffeinate}} that keeps the screen turned on either until stopped, for a set duration of time or while another process still runs.
		\item \href{https://github.com/AppleGamer22/stalk}{\texttt{stalk}} is a cross-platform file-watcher that can run a command after each file-system operation on a given files or simply wait once until a file is changed.
		\item \href{https://github.com/AppleGamer22/raker}{\texttt{raker}} is a social media scraper that is interfaced via a server-side rendered HTML user interface (or a CLI), and is managed by a REST API and a NoSQL database.
		\item \href{https://github.com/AppleGamer22/scr-web}{scr-web} (and its \href{https://github.com/AppleGamer22/scr-cli}{scr-cli} counterpart) is my previous attempt at building a full-stack social media scraper with \href{https://angular.io}{Angular} on the front-end, and \href{https://nestjs.com}{Nest} on the back-end.
		\item \href{https://github.com/AppleGamer22/sp}{sp} is my first attempt at building a Minecraft server plugin. This plugin adds the requirement that the player supplies the password (via a server command) before proper server interaction is allowed, and as long as the password isn't provided, the currently-unauthorized player is blinded and immobile.
		% \item \href{https://github.com/monsec/ctftime-discord-bot}{ctftime-discord-bot} is a discord bot I made for the \href{https://monsec.io}{MonSec} Discord server, that fetches statistics about competing teams from \href{https://ctftime.org}{CTFtime}, and displays them in the Discord interface.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Research}
	\cventry{August 2021 \\ December 2021}{Software Contributor}{Monash University's \href{https://handbook.monash.edu/2021/units/FIT2082}{FIT2082 unit}}{Melbourne}{}{\begin{itemize}
		\item I \href{https://github.com/AppleGamer22/FIT2082}{contributed} to an \href{https://bitbucket.org/gkgange/lazycbs}{existing codebase}, based on prior research by \href{https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/3471}{(Gange, Harabor and Stuckey, 2021)} about \textsl{Lazy CBS}, their \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding\#Multi-agent_pathfinding}{Multi-Agent Path Finding} (MAPF) algorithm.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item I modified the \textsl{Lazy CBS} codebase such that the algorithm also outputs the final set of constraints that is used to rule out paths, such that \textsl{Lazy CBS} is formally an \textbf{Explainable} Multi-Agent Path Finding (XMAPF) algorithm.
			\item I learned how to enable \httplink[\textsl{Python}-to-\textsl{C++} bindings]{pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}, such that the compiled \textsl{Lazy CBS} codebase can be used as a Python-facing library for future projects.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}}

	\subsection{Freelancing}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I implemented a fault-tolerant file back-up system that enables the continuation of file transferring from an variably-approximate point in time before the back-up disruption.
	\end{itemize}

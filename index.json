Tailscale provides a cloud-init3 configuration that can be added to most cloud providers\u0026rsquo; compute instances in order to automatically connect a compute instance to a tailnet.\n#cloud-config # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/cloud-init/main/cloudinit/config/schemas/versions.schema.cloud-config.json runcmd: - curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh - [\u0026#39;sh\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;-c\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;echo \u0026#39;net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\u0026#39; | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo \u0026#39;net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1\u0026#39; | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf\u0026#34; ] - tailscale up --advertise-exit-node --ssh --accept-routes --advertise-routes=${routes} --accept-dns=${accept_dns} --authkey=${tailscale_auth_key} This file can be used by OpenTofu/Terraform4 to fill-in the automatically-provisioned tailnet key.\ndata \u0026#34;template_cloudinit_config\u0026#34; \u0026#34;config\u0026#34; { gzip = true base64_encode = true part { content_type = \u0026#34;text/cloud-config\u0026#34; content = templatefile(\u0026#34;${path.module}/../../cloud_init.yml\u0026#34;, { tailscale_auth_key = module.ts.tailnet_key routes = \u0026#34;10.1.0.0/24,168.63.129.16/32\u0026#34; accept_dns = false }) } } Authorising The Device #Tailscale Terraform provider can reference the device through it\u0026rsquo;s tailscale_device resource. In this example it depends on an Azure Linux VM, but this can be changed for any other cloud provider\u0026rsquo;s OpenTofu/Terraform compute resource that accepts a cloud-init configuration similar to the one mentioned above.\ndata \u0026#34;tailscale_device\u0026#34; \u0026#34;azVM\u0026#34; { hostname = azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.azVM.computer_name wait_for = \u0026#34;120s\u0026#34; } The tailscale_device resource waits for 2 minutes for the VM to boot (counting from its provisioning time), run the script in its cloud-init configuration and join the tailnet. This resource can be used to declaratively pre-authorise the device into the tailnet and define it\u0026rsquo;s routes.\nresource \u0026#34;tailscale_device_authorization\u0026#34; \u0026#34;azVM\u0026#34; { device_id = data.tailscale_device.azVM.node_id authorized = true } resource \u0026#34;tailscale_device_subnet_routes\u0026#34; \u0026#34;azVM\u0026#34; { device_id = data.tailscale_device.azVM.node_id routes = [ \u0026#34;10.1.0.0/24\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;168.63.129.16/32\u0026#34;, # Configure as an exit node \u0026#34;0.0.0.0/0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;::/0\u0026#34;, ] } Af this stage the automatically-provisioned VM is acting is a regular exit node in the tailnet that is accessible by any user with the vpn tag.\nDecommissioning The Device On-Demand #OpenTofu/Terraform can run external commands in order to fill the gaps that a given provider hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet addressed, but these capability should be used as a last resort. By using a provisioner that is run on tofu destroy, the Tailscale API is invoked directly in order to remove the decommissioned device off the tailnet.\nresource \u0026#34;terraform_data\u0026#34; \u0026#34;tailscale_device_cleanup\u0026#34; { input = { device_id = data.tailscale_device.azVM.id tailscale_api_key = var.tailscale_api_key } provisioner \u0026#34;local-exec\u0026#34; { when = destroy # in case the device has been removed manually on_failure = continue command = \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOT curl \u0026#39;https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/device/${self.input.device_id}\u0026#39; \\ --request DELETE \\ --header \u0026#39;Authorization: Bearer ${self.input.tailscale_api_key}\u0026#39; EOT } } However, using this provisioner by itself gives OpenTofu/Terraform no knowledge of the dependency graph. This was demonstrated on the first time I tried to run tofu destroy, after which I expected the Tailscale device entry for the VM to be cleanly removed alongside the rest of the tailscale_device_authorization and tailscale_device_subnet_routes resources. However, the provisioner for terraform_data.tailscale_device_cleanup was run as soon as possible, which happened to be before the above-mentioned resources were decommissioned cleanly. This sloppy order of execution prevented the clean continuation for the rest of the pipeline.\nLuckily there is an easy fix.\nCorrecting The Resource Dependency Graph #This issue stems from the fact that Tailscale\u0026rsquo;s Terraform provider doesn\u0026rsquo;t track the decommissioning of the tailscale_device resource (currently being discussed on GitHub), which means I had to implement a similar behaviour on my own. When additional resources are derived from the device\u0026rsquo;s data resource, the device\u0026rsquo;s destroy-time provisioner need to have a similar dependency graph in order to ensure it runs after all of the device\u0026rsquo;s derived resources are destroyed.\nflowchart TD D[Taiscale Device] --\u0026gt;|depends on| VM DA[Device Authorization] --\u0026gt;|depends on| D DSR[Device Subnet Routes] --\u0026gt;|depends on| D DA --\u0026gt;|depends on| DC[Device Clean-up] DSR --\u0026gt;|depends on| DC These additional dependencies can be defined declaratively by adding terraform_data.tailscale_device_cleanup to the depends_on attribute of tailscale_device_authorization and tailscale_device_subnet_routes.\nresource \u0026#34;tailscale_device_authorization\u0026#34; \u0026#34;azVM\u0026#34; { device_id = data.tailscale_device.azVM.node_id depends_on = [terraform_data.tailscale_device_cleanup] authorized = true } resource \u0026#34;tailscale_device_subnet_routes\u0026#34; \u0026#34;azVM\u0026#34; { device_id = data.tailscale_device.azVM.node_id depends_on = [terraform_data.tailscale_device_cleanup] routes = [ \u0026#34;10.1.0.0/24\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;168.63.129.16/32\u0026#34;, # Configure as an exit node \u0026#34;0.0.0.0/0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;::/0\u0026#34;, ] } With these small modifications, cloud-hosted VMs can be added to the tailnet seamlessly with ACL tags and routing authorisations pre-defined, and be decommissioned just as easily.\nP S, H.

While it definitely reduced to the total bundle size of the website, it didn\u0026rsquo;t affect the build time.\nExpired Cache #I think I explored this possibility last because Hugo abstract its caching mechanism so well. Regardless, here is my reasoning as to how the caching discrepancy occurred:\nWith each change, Hugo only updated the changed pages and using the cache for the rest of the pages, thus keeping the build times snappy. The CI workflow that builds and deploys the website after every commit pushed into the master branch has its own Hugo cache that closely follows the local one on my machine. As long as the CI cache is maintained, the build times should roughly match between the local and CI environments. Due to an older Hugo update and GitHub\u0026rsquo;s cache expiry policy, the local and CI caches diverted out of sync, with the local cache remaining and the CI cache no longer available. With the CI cache expired, building the website in the current and more resource heavy form proved to take more than the default timeout1 of 30 seconds. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s Cache #From researching the relevant documentation of Hugo2 and the Hugo set-up GitHub Actions module3 I understood that in version 0.116.0, the default path of the cache directory was updated (from /tmp/hugo_cache_runner to /home/runner/.cache/hugo_cache) in order to be more appropriate to each supported operating system. With this path being missing from the CI cache, it was bound to get expired at some point.\nGitHub Actions Caching Policy #GitHub encourages the use of their caching system for developer that use GitHub Actions to continuously build their software with third-party dependencies and want to save some on downloading their dependencies. In order for this feature to be financially viable, old cache entries should be evicted, especially since newer entries will be used more often. Through this experience, I learnt this about GitHub Actions caching4:\nCache entries that have not been accessed in over 7 days will be evicted. Regardless of cache entry age, once a repository reaches the maximum cache size of 10 GB, the oldest cache entry in the repository will be deleted. Replicating CI Conditions Locally #After I realised the culprit for the build time issue, I wanted to debug the building process of the website locally with the added condition of unavailable cached resources. Luckily Hugo has the --ignoreCache flag, which I toggled on and off as I observed its effects and verified my caching hypothesis. Moreover, I increased the timeout value to 2 minutes in order to allow the website to fully build with no cache, which might happen if I don\u0026rsquo;t update it often and the CI cache expires. In this case, the CI workflow will take more time to successfully finish, but it will generate a new cache entry for the next time it runs.\nLessons Learned # If a software like Hugo exhibits unusually optimised performance compared to other offerings in its class, make sure to study it and appreciate the effort its contributors put into making it.\nMake sure you understand how caching policies affect your build procedure in CI-like conditions before you opt into using caches.\nMake sure to update caching paths in CI:\n# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://json.schemastore.org/github-workflow.json name: GitHub Pages # ... jobs: pages: # ... steps: # ... - name: Cache uses: actions/cache@v4 with: path: | /home/runner/.cache/hugo_cache /tmp/hugo_cache_runner resources/_gen/images key: ${{runner.os}}-hugomod-${{hashFiles(\u0026#39;**/go.sum\u0026#39;)}} restore-keys: ${{runner.os}}-hugomod- # ...

The following year\u0026rsquo;s orientation week, I noticed some familiar names on the cohort\u0026rsquo;s Discord server mentioning they will be representing the cyber-security club at the student association\u0026rsquo;s orientation festival. Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t know anybody else that went to that event, I decided to check their booth out. The first 2 people I met from MonSec were Leo and Luca, who were super-friendly, they asked me of my previous experience and presented me with nifty lock-picking and cryptography challenges. The most memorable part was when Leo asked me of my previous experience, and I jokingly said \u0026ldquo;I use Arch by the way\u0026rdquo; (note to self: that joke went horribly in retrospective).\nAssistant Member Training Officer #It turns out that there were some available positions in the MonSec committee at the beginning of 2021, I was pondering if I should try applying. I asked Leo about it during a Java class we both attended, and he said that I should go for it. In the application form, I wrote a short summary about myself, with a link to my GitHub, in order to showcase my previous experience as evidence to my work ethic. That seemed to make the difference, because after a few weeks, the committee announced that I got accepted, and I asked them why it turns out I was of a few people that included external hyperlinks as evidence to my projects.\nDuring this period of a semester and a bit, I learned about how MonSec works from behind the scenes, ran an online workshop whose demo didn\u0026rsquo;t go as planned (immensely valuable for troubleshooting future workshops). The conversation I remember the most from this period was my introduction to the then-secretary, Luke who told that the MonSec team culture is based on recognising that the MonSec committee members are students, thus being relatively relaxed with deadlines is a requirement. At the time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand how critical it was that we made that part of the team culture official from the start of each term, but it made my presidency much more enjoyable.\nSecretary #The following year I moved to a more paperwork-heavy and administrative role, that involved record keeping of the committee and general meetings. I found it hard to parallelise the functions of documenting the meeting, and being attentive to what is being said. This struggle lead me to use several methods of documentation, such as a multi-media recording of the meeting, thus diversifying the dependency from one source of truth to multiple. In addition, I saw an opportunity to automate some repetitive routines, mainly the generation of plots for the semi-annual general meeting reports. I wrote a Python script that ingests the membership log of the club, and produces a set of plots for future secretaries to use in their report.\nDuring this semester I ran my first workshop for the year on reverse-engineering, sadly from home due to a COVID-19-positive test result.\nVice-President #Towards the end of 2022\u0026rsquo;s first semester, the then-president Peter notified the committee of his intention to resign during the Ordinary General Meeting (OGM). As expected from a relatively-niche club of the size we where at the time, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a guarantee that we could fill the vacancy by having someone new (to the committee) putting their name on the ballot for such a senior role. In order to keep MonSec running, we had to step up and be ready to accept a role with more responsibility, and teach what we learned to the person that replaces us in the previous role. After more than a year later, it\u0026rsquo;s safe to say that the MonSec team showed their versatility as most of the committee had to learn and perform a new role at the same time with far less preparation time. It should also be noted that this versatility positively impacted the committee transition to 2023.\nMonSec at AISA CyberCon 2022 This role was an amazing preparation to the next year, as I got to talk to academic and industry stakeholders such as researchers, university staff, sponsors and partners and plan future engagements with them.\nDuring this semester, I ran a beginner-level workshop about steganography, the art of hiding information in plain sight within other pieces of information. In addition, Akbar and myself began working on the Kali Linux set-up guide1 around this time, as we saw commonalities in the troubleshooting methodologies we employed to help our members get their virtual machine running running.\nPresident #Before Peter\u0026rsquo;s role ended, he handled the paperwork required to register MonSec as a non-profit organisation, which he intended to be used for discounted digital infrastructure. Initially, we intended to focus on transitioning our CTFd server to Microsoft Azure, since they offer a non-profit grant that will be substantially cheaper for us. Our systems administrator Matti, did a tremendous work learning Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in order to have our Azure resources documented. His work enabled the next system administrator, Kar Jun to up-skill himself, and it also gave me an excuse to learn Terraform as well.\nWith the 2023 committee assembled, I had some plans to make the club\u0026rsquo;s mission reach more people through improved social media.\nMonSec\u0026rsquo;s 2022 Annual General Meeting Preparation #We started by planning the events we will have during semester 1, which included our weekly workshops and the promotional activities during the orientation festival. Since I haven\u0026rsquo;t worked extensively with most of the team beforehand, I got to know them and their goals for the club and their roles throughout the summer break. I wanted to be sure that all of the team members understand their part in the club\u0026rsquo;s mission and the time commitment the team members can expect from each other. I felt this was important to define since the team is composed of university students, thus making it unrealistic to expect the same level of commitment of everyone regardless of their individual circumstances.\n2023 Semester 1 #We started the semester 12 at the orientation stall, where the team introduced MonSec to new students, with goal of getting Monash University students to attend our weekly workshops.\nThe MonSec Team at The 2023S1 Orientation Festival We used the classic analogy of lock-picking to explain the philosophy of hacking to new MonSec members. This method has been demonstrated in every orientation festival to be very effective in attracting curious students to attend our events.\nNewly-registered MonSec Members Try Lock-picking We featured a several guest speakers that showcased our shared passion for cyber-security and the curiosity that it entails.\nCallum, Harris \u0026amp; Natasha with our members after their insightful talk about DFIR \u0026amp; industry landscape Due to Elias graduating in semester 1, we had to elect a new vice-president, and to fill a vacant sponsorship officer position. We enthusiastically welcomed Sarah as VP and Oscar as sponsorship officer.\nMonSec\u0026rsquo;s 2023 Ordinary General Meeting During this semester I ran a beginner-level workshop about one of my favourite topics, the Linux command-line interface and how to use it\u0026rsquo;s user permission system.\nBeginner CTF #We held our annual beginner-friendly Capture The Flag event, this time with support from EY that provided the catering and some of their talented consultants. With their help, the CTF participants had a better understanding of the challenges and of the cyber-security industry.\nMonSec Committee \u0026amp; EY’s Advanced Security Center’s consultants 2023 Semester 2 #We started semester 23 by planning the progression of weekly events, which (like all good plans) we had to modify several times throughout the semester. We also took part in a smaller orientation festival, which surprisingly yielded more members. In addition, we also worked on a new sponsorship prospectus and a slightly-revised website, both to serve as a long-term framework for further enhancements in our online presence.\nThe MonSec Team at The 2023S2 Orientation Festival During this semester I ran 2 workshops about reverse-engineering (2nd iteration) and about reverse shells.\nMy Reverse Shell Workshop We also had a couple of workshops that are a bit different then what we usually have been doing. We partnered with Nick from The Legal Forecast to run a workshop/discussion with our members about the various legal frameworks that seek to guard our privacy.\nSarah \u0026amp; myself with Nick from The Legal Forecast Overall, I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with the impact I had on MonSec throughout the last year, especially with how we work with each other and other organisations.\nMonSec 2023 committee\u0026rsquo;s last team photo The Future #The committee is in the the midst of the handover period, and I\u0026rsquo;m beyond impressed by their dedication. Planning for next year\u0026rsquo;s events is underway, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure next year\u0026rsquo;s MonSec members will be pleased with the breadth of workshop concepts and guest speaker sessions that will be featured.\nMonSec \u0026amp; Friends at ANZ UnConference23 I should emphasise that Rohan, Oscar and myself aren\u0026rsquo;t officially related to Cloudflare, as we just think their shirt looks cool.\nCredits #This journey was not possible without my teammates and friends that made this experience one of the highlights of my degree.\nLeo has been instrumental in shaping how MonSec runs its technical workshops, which is evident by the unique taste and style of the educational content he produced. Peter was immensely helpful in registering MonSec as a not-for-profit organisation, along with providing the committee with meaningful guidance. Emily, Luke, James, Luca and Marcus were crucial in showing how to be a productive team member in a stressful time such as in during the COVID-19 pandemic. Akbar has been instrumental in maintaining our media pipeline and our website, along with being a diligent secretary. Matti was the cornerstone of MonSec\u0026rsquo;s cloud migration effort, which is safe to say he nailed. In addition he taught me a lot regarding server administration throughout his time with MonSec. Yuki has been a joy to work with, especially due to his passion for cyber-security and due to his ability to go above and beyond with organising the club\u0026rsquo;s files and workflows, running and helping with technical workshops and being a go-to person for many of our members. Sean was essential for maintaining the club\u0026rsquo;s financial records during my presidency, which he did flawlessly even throughout his industry internship. Jamie has transformed the club\u0026rsquo;s media pipeline with Canva, which enabled a more diverse design capability and tighter collaboration, while maintaining a vibrant social media presence for the club. Elias has been an amazing friend and vice-president, and because of his persistance we managed to secure a sponsor for the Beginner CTF. Moreover, he also went above and beyond to run a weekly CTF-like walkthrough on the club\u0026rsquo;s Discord server. Kar Jun maintained the clubs cloud infrastructure for the CTFd server we use in our events, which was executed perfectly while learning our management practices and troubleshooting in real-time. Preeti has been vital for the club\u0026rsquo;s engagement with members, as she\u0026rsquo;s been helping to troubleshoot and clarify issues during our workshops. Sarah has been expanding the club\u0026rsquo;s relations with the industry, the university and the greater community, which will be utilised next year. In addition she has also been editing the workshop recordings and helping with the social media publications, preparing and running several workshops, and helping the members to troubleshoot. Oscar has been essential in the recent engagements with industry stakeholders such as sponsors and partners, and I reckon the outcome of his current work will become visible soon. He also professionally captured the photos of our events throughout 2023. Rahul and Chloe helped my team with designing high-quality posters for our weekly workshops\u0026rsquo; social media publications. The distinct quality of their work can be easily observed when compared to our other publications. Rohan has been the bridge between the Faculty of Information Technology\u0026rsquo;s student engagement operations and MonSec, and he made these discussions a breeze. Moreover, MonSec owes many thanks to our friends in the university and industry:\nShujie Cui, Xingliang Yuan, Carsten Rudolph, Monica Whitty and Pierre Le Bodic from the Faculty of Information Technology have been tremendously helpful by helping MonSec book venues on campus, advertising our events through the faculty\u0026rsquo;s social media, helping to finance our events throughout our history and connecting us with the wider education ecosystem. Catherine Karavias and the faculty\u0026rsquo;s student engagement team were incredibly supportive by advertising MonSec in the student newsletter and helping us with event financing. Harris Wassylko, Callum Rogers, Natasha Doyle and Chathura Abeydeera have been extremely helpful with collaborating on industry workshop with us. Nicholas Dyson from The Legal Forecast delivered an insightful workshop on the various privacy regulations and how they affect cyber-security practitioners. Dan Maslin with his team, and Sajeeb Lohani were immensely influential by helping MonSec to expand its university and industry networks. And of course, none of this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been possible without our awesome members, sponsors and partners.\nMain Takeaways #This post would have been meaningless if I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have laid out my key lessons from being part of MonSec:\nKeep nurturing a wholesome team culture, everything else depends on that. Learn from experiences of previous committees (and from yours as well). Focus on your club\u0026rsquo;s mission according to its definition. Understand and mitigate your skill deficiency over time. Engage with the club members as much as possible, and ask them how the club is doing. I\u0026rsquo;m sure MonSec will continue being just as or even more of a wholesome group of passionate ethical hackers, and even though I\u0026rsquo;m no longer involved in its leadership I\u0026rsquo;ll always be happy to help them out where I can.\nHopefully Mutahar appreciates this meme… (made with GIMP) Bornstein O. \u0026amp; Fadiansyah A.

In addition, I found some events had an empty Name property, which is probably related to a write event on one of the root directories the file watcher is assigned to. At present, I filter out the above-mentioned subset of events because this subset of events has no meaning for a general file watcher like stalk, but you should decide for your use case how much filtering your code should perform.\nAfter filtering out unwanted events, you can write custom code that handles this events as per your use case.\ngo func() { lastEventTime := time.Unix(0, 0) for { select { case event := \u0026lt;-watcher.Events: eventType := event.Op != fsnotify.Write \u0026amp;\u0026amp; event.Op != fsnotify.Create eventTime := time.Since(lastEventTime) \u0026lt;= time.Second/10 if event.Name == \u0026#34;\u0026#34; || eventType || eventTime { continue } // do something in a thread-safe manner case err := \u0026lt;-watcher.Errors: // deal with error, can either stop watching by breaking from the loop // can report error by pushing to global error channel } } }() Adding Files to Watch #While the file watcher waits for events, a separate thread adds the files to be watched in parallel.

Assuming the file watcher initialisation and termination logic are in the same function, any return statement after the file watcher\u0026rsquo;s creation will trigger its defer statement, thus exiting cleanly.

If you have never heard of this standard, you might have heard of Docker, which is the first implementation of this standard\u0026rsquo;s specification. Configuring GoReleaser to build/publish OCI-compliant container images allows easier multi-registry publishing, multi-platform builds, and injecting environment variables to linker flags by reusing the binaries it already built.\nThis snippet allows GoReleaser to build a binary similarly to the CLI binary shown above, only with CGo disabled and a different path for the main package and Version variable. These binaries can be reused for the container build (by COPYing the binary directly to the container) to generate a platform-specific images, which are merged to a single manifest for your new version.\n# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://goreleaser.com/static/schema.json # ... builds: - id: linux env: [CGO_ENABLED=0] main: ./server goos: - linux goarch: - amd64 - arm64 ldflags: - -s -w - -X \u0026#39;github.com/AppleGamer22/{{.ProjectName}}/shared.Version={{.Version}}\u0026#39; - -X \u0026#39;github.com/AppleGamer22/{{.ProjectName}}/shared.Hash={{.FullCommit}}\u0026#39; # ... dockers: - use: buildx goarch: amd64 image_templates: - docker.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}}-amd64 - ghcr.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}}-amd64 build_flag_templates: - --pull - --platform=linux/amd64 - --label=org.opencontainers.image.created={{.Date}} - --label=org.opencontainers.image.title={{.ProjectName}} - --label=org.opencontainers.image.revision={{.FullCommit}} - --label=org.opencontainers.image.version={{.Version}} - use: buildx goarch: arm64 image_templates: - docker.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}}-arm64 - ghcr.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}}-arm64 build_flag_templates: - --pull - --platform=linux/arm64 - --label=org.opencontainers.image.created={{.Date}} - --label=org.opencontainers.image.title={{.ProjectName}} - --label=org.opencontainers.image.revision={{.FullCommit}} - --label=org.opencontainers.image.version={{.Version}} docker_manifests: - name_template: docker.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}} image_templates: - docker.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}}-amd64 - docker.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}}-arm64 - name_template: ghcr.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}} image_templates: - ghcr.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}}-amd64 - ghcr.io/applegamer22/{{.ProjectName}}:{{.Version}}-arm64 In order to reference external files, you can either list them in the extra_files (or templated_extra_files) array. Another way would be embedding the files inside your Go binary using the embed package. Here is a summary of how I used it to embed HTML templates and static assets.\n//go:embed templates/*.html var templates embed.FS Templates = template.Must(template.New(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;).Funcs(funcs).ParseFS(templates, \u0026#34;*.html\u0026#34;)) // ... //go:embed assets/* var assets embed.FS mux.Handle(\u0026#34;/assets/\u0026#34;, http.StripPrefix(\u0026#34;/assets/\u0026#34;, http.FileServer(http.FS(assets)))) In order to make your Dockerfile work well with GoReleaser, the main application binary would have to be sourced by a COPY command (with the appropriate executable name). Other adjustments like external dependencies can be done as usual.\nFROM alpine:3.21.3 WORKDIR /raker COPY raker . RUN apk add ffmpeg ENV STORAGE=\u0026#34;/raker/storage\u0026#34; ENV DATABASE=\u0026#34;raker\u0026#34; EXPOSE 4100 CMD ./raker Software Bill of Materials #In order to allow easier automated security analysis by third-parties, GoReleaser can create a Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) for other people to analyse and potentially find issues your software\u0026rsquo;s dependencies more easily. In the following example, a separate SBoM for each package binary (and the source code) is made, and uploaded to your preferred publishing channel.\nsyft is required as a dependency of GoReleaser for this feature to work.\n# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://goreleaser.com/static/schema.json # ... sboms: - artifacts: source - artifacts: package - artifacts: archive - artifacts: binary Debugging #Since debugging continuos integration configurations purely by running your CI workflow repeatedly is very exhausting, the goreleaser CLI is available to be run on your preferred environment. In addition, most of this commands can be easily integrated into an existing Makefile-based workflow.\ngoreleaser check is useful for validating your configuration\u0026rsquo;s syntax. goreleaser build is useful for building the binaries for later inspection. goreleaser release is used to build, package and release the artifacts. The --skip publish (shown as the older --skip-publish option in the GIF below) flag is useful for inspecting the packages without publishing. The --snapshot flag is useful for ignoring the version tag. The --clean flag is useful for cleaning-up the filesystem after publishing the artifacts. Continuous Integration #Since GoReleaser is published as a CLI, its highly-programmable nature allows easy integration into custom automated workflows.\nGitHub Actions #I use GoReleaser GitHub Actions integration to build, package and release my open-source projects automatically after a stable semantic version git tag is pushed to GitHub.

The screensaver inhibitor can wait for either a termination signal, or for an optionally-provided duration. The screensaver inhibitor\u0026rsquo;s session is tracked by a data structure with the specified duration, and a termination signals channel, linked to the process\u0026rsquo; signal buffer.\ns := Session{ Duration: duration, Signals: make(chan os.Signal, 1), } signal.Notify(s.Signals, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM, syscall.SIGQUIT) The part of the code shown below is how I used to implement the CLI functionality that waits for either:\na timer (with user-specified duration) to end. This is triggered by a time.Time object sent to the channel returned by the time.After function, which occurs after the duration specified in the function\u0026rsquo;s input, or for the user to manually stop the screensaver inhibitor. This is triggered by a channel that listens for terminations signals sent to the programs by either the operating system, or the user via the command-line shell. select { case \u0026lt;-time.After(s.Duration): case \u0026lt;-s.Signals: } Potential Channel Leaks #The issue starts when the user terminates the screen inhibitor session before the timer (with the duration specified in the CLI\u0026rsquo;s arguments) ends. According to the documentation of time.After1:\nAfter waits for the duration to elapse and then sends the current time on the returned channel. It is equivalent to NewTimer(d).C. The underlying Timer is not recovered by the garbage collector until the timer fires. If efficiency is a concern, use NewTimer instead and call Timer.Stop if the timer is no longer needed.\n%%{init: {\u0026#34;sequence\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;mirrorActors\u0026#34;: false}}}%% sequenceDiagram participant CLI actor User participant Timer par CLI to User loop CLI-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;User: check for termination signal activate User end User-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;CLI: terminate session deactivate User Note over User,Timer: Timer\u0026#39;s channel still exists and CLI to Timer loop CLI-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Timer: check for duration end signal end end Therefore, in this case, if the user sends a termination signal, the timer\u0026rsquo;s channel continues to exists in the heap until its duration is over, because it\u0026rsquo;s not stopped manually. Over the course of time between the receiving of the termination signal to the end of the timer\u0026rsquo;s duration, the timer\u0026rsquo;s channel is still accessible despite no longer being read by the program, which constitutes a memory leak2, which may lead to performance and reliability issues. I should also note that this is an issue only when cocainate\u0026rsquo;s code is imported as a Go module3 to other codebases that don\u0026rsquo;t immediately terminate the entire process upon receiving a termination signal.\nHow I Fixed It #In this commit (shown below), I use a a complete time.Timer object rather than just its channel (as advised by Go\u0026rsquo;s standard library documentation), which allows me to close its channel after a termination signal is received. Since now the timer\u0026rsquo;s channel is closed when it\u0026rsquo;s no longer necessary, it allows Go\u0026rsquo;s garbage collector to clean it sooner, thus preventing the memory leak and the problems it can cause down the line.\ntimer := time.NewTimer(s.Duration) select { case \u0026lt;-timer.C: case \u0026lt;-s.Signals: timer.Stop() } time.After\u0026rsquo;s Function Documentation (https://pkg.go.dev/time#After)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMemory Leak Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nBui-Palsulich, T., \u0026amp; Compton, E.

A count array is maintained for every sub-box $(i, j)$ with coordinate $(y, x)$, such that $j \\leq y \u0026lt; j + 3$, and such that $i \\leq x \u0026lt; i + 3$. After all values of the coordinates in the $3 \\times 3$ sub-box with upper-left corner $(i, j)$ have been recorded in the count array, it\u0026rsquo;s iterated through to check for any counts that are not strictly 1.\nGo Implementation #func CheckSudoku(matrix [9][9]int) bool { // check row and column conditions for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 9; i++ { var row_count, column_count [9]int for j := 0; j \u0026lt; 9; j++ { // row-wise/column-wise matrix coordinates (i, j) and (j, i) row_count[matrix[i][j]-1]++ column_count[matrix[j][i]-1]++ } for digit := 0; digit \u0026lt; 9; digit++ { row_condition := row_count[digit] != 1 column_condition := column_count[digit] != 1 if row_condition || column_condition { return false } } } // check sub-box conditions for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 9; i += 3 { for j := 0; j \u0026lt; 9; j += 3 { // (i, j) represents the upper-left corner of each Sudoku sub-box var box_count [9]int for y := j; y \u0026lt; j+3; y++ { for x := i; x \u0026lt; i+3; x++ { // 3x3 Sudoku sub-matrix-wise coordinates (y, x) box_count[matrix[y][x]-1]++ } } for _, count := range box_count { if count != 1 { return false } } } } return true } You can run the above-mentioned code from your browser with the following Go Playground.\nCburnett.

The python script attached:\nslices the ciphertext to all possible 5 characters-long (assuming 2 hexadecimal digits are equivalent to 1 ASCII characters) sections, computes possible_key = ciphertext ^ known_cleartext, for a known substring of actf{, expands the key to the ASCII length of the message, rotates the key to deal with cases where the known clear text is not in an index that is a multiple of the key length.

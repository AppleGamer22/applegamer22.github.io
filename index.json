The python script attached:\nslices the ciphertext to all possible 5 characters-long (assuming 2 hexadecimal digits are equivalent to 1 ASCII characters) sections, computes possible_key = ciphertext ^ known_cleartext, for a known substring of actf{, expands the key to the ASCII length of the message, rotates the key to deal with cases where the known clear text is not in an index that is a multiple of the key length. Thanks to @Levon for this suggestion. recomputes the XOR to possibly decode the message and prints the possible message as ASCII.

Other Projects # Research # As part of the FIT2082 unit, I contributed to an existing codebase, based on prior research by (Gange, Harabor and Stuckey, 2021) about Lazy CBS, their Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm. I modified the Lazy CBS codebase such that the algorithm also outputs the final set of constraints that is used to rule out paths, such that the Lazy CBS is formally an Explainable Multi-Agent Path Finding (XMAPF) algorithm. I learned how to enable Python-to-C++ bindings, such that the compiled Lazy CBS codebase can be used as a Python-facing library for future projects.
